# splat-files
Diverse splat files under CC0 for testing and tryout purposes.

You will find ply, compressed ply (playcanvas type), .npz, and SOGS

- ply: original file type used by OG gaussian paper. Ply can be for meshes too, not always splats (in this repo they are splats only)
- sogs: very efficient compression. Loosy but not too much. (.sog is v2, meta.json files with webp files beside it is v1)
- compressed ply (playcanvas type). Quite loosy but not a disaster.
- .npz (niantic compression format, very loosy)
